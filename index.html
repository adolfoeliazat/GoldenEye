	<h3>What</h3>
	<p><i>GoldenEye</i> is a central face recognition based authentication service/system for Android. Android applications can use this service to verify the current user before using the saved login credentials for authentication.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Why</h3>
	<p>Mobile web access on smartphones and netbooks is very popular due to the high availability of wireless internet and improved user interfaces. Advancements in social networking and location sensing have led to a large number of native smartphone applications for the web. An increasing need to share content through social networking services has led to occasional sharing of smartphone and netbook access among users. Instant messaging and quick access to emails are other reasons for sharing access.
<br><br>Native smartphone applications that connect to the web require authentication through username and password. When applications are installed, the owner of the phone usually configures them to work with his/her account permanently. The application saves the login credentials for convenience and enables an always-logged-in mode for the owner. This poses a serious threat to privacy when multiple users access the same device. Due to the relatively small size of smartphone screens, it is hard for the onlooker to notice people sniffing on private data stored on the smartphone during their occasional access.  Just like other portable electronic devices, smartphones are attractive targets for thieves. In any case, if the worst happens it is important that the user's private information remains well protected.<br><br>
Switching off always-logged-in modes to safegaurd privacy introduces the annoyance of having to repeatedly type usernames and obscure passwords on the smartphone. Unfortunately, the openID standard of authentication has been adopted only by a minor subset of web-based services. The effectiveness of touchscreen typing is improving rapidly due to technological advancements. Yet, they may never match the ergonomics of a keyboard or typewriter due to the small size of smartphone screens.<br><br>
There is clearly a rising need to accommodate a central system on mobile platforms that can offer services to ease multiple user authentication on the same device. Biometric identification mechanisms that can cleverly handle false negatives and false positives are a best fit for this requirement. Modern smartphones come equipped with supremely effective cameras that offer solid support for using a facial recognition system to solve the above problem.
